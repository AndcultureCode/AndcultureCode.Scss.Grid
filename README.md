# AndcultureCode

We are the engineering team at andculture focused on developing technology solutions. Come build with us.

While we use a wide array of technologies at andculture, we tend to build primarily in .NET Core C# and React TypeScript. The goal of this repository is to document our engineering team best practices around specific technologies as well as the department at large.
